        At the end of 2022, I quit my job as a software engineer to go fulltime
        into building and scaling my own SaaS businesses. In the past, I pursued
        a double degree in computer science and business, interned at big tech
        companies in Sil// icon Valley, and competed in over 21 hackathons for
        fun. I also had the pleasure of being a part of the first ever in-person
        cohort of buildspace called buildspace sf1.
